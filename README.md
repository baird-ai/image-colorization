## Project Description

One of the most exciting applications of deep learning is colorizing black and white images. This task needed a lot of human input and hardcoding several years ago but now the whole process can be done end-to-end with the power of AI and deep learning. Colorization is a process of converting grayscale images into visually acceptable color images. The main goal is to convince the viewer of the authenticity of the result by combining the GAN and the U-NET methodologies.
